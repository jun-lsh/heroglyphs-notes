## Sharing an ID Across Multiple Validators

According to the docs, you can now create a Parent-Child relationship between validators. This means that you can reuse an ID across multiple validators, as long as the validator is registered as a "child" of an ID.

Previously, if you wanted to use multiple validators you would have to mint a unique ID for each of them, and the graffiti that the validator mints has to match the ID 

e.g. Validator with ID of `@abc` can only receive tokens if they append graffitis with `@abc`, if they were to put any other ID like `@xyz` in their graffiti, the graffiti is voided and the address associated with `@xyz` does not receive any tokens, nor does the address associated with `@abc`


This is still the case. This Parent-Child system does not mean that IDs can be reminted for multiple validators! Every validator still requires its own unique ID.

However, with the [IdentityRouter.sol](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x83d55452d95cc914e33bcd43e8c9be1ffe422994#contracts) contract, it seems like you can "hook" an arbitrary number of children to a parent identity: [here](https://arbiscan.io/tx/0x1810a88c7ad28907c1ea6875e76cb40614d776c2372594cfe49298f487a325e9) is an example tx of someone hooking their child `@ra` to a parent ID `@C`. 

This means that the validator associated with `@ra` can now mint graffitis with `@C` and the owner of both validators can receive the rewards for it (deposited to the wallet associated with `@C`). I can now mint a very long ID for a validator, then simply hook it to a far shorter ID and retain my abiltiy to mint multiple tokens per graffiti.

The intrinsic value of this is to be able to reuse short validator IDs across multiple validators, and this feels like a rework of the "delegation" system initially present in V1. 


## What Happens to Dead Tickers?

As previously discussed, a ticker owner has to continually pay taxes to keep the ticker "afloat". It seems like if the taxes were to go unpaid and the ticker becomes hijackable, the ticker is considered "surrendered" and you simply stop being able to receive any of the associate tokens.

### Doubling Up Tickers

However, given that the Heroglyphs tokens are associated with a contract, you can actually mint multiple tickers that points to the same contract, and even if one of those tickers goes underwater, you can continue receiving the tokens via the other tickers. 

e.g. `#ABC` and `#XYZ` both point to some token `$EX`. The owner of `#ABC` stops paying its tax and the ticker goes underwater, so graffitis minted with the ticker `#ABC` no longer receive any `$EX`. However, you can simply switch to minting graffitis with the token `#XYZ` instead, and continue to receive `$EX`.

This sort of behaviour can be disabled via the contract itself (the Heroglyphs team recognizes this as a possible Repeat Attack, e.g. having a graffiti minted with two tickers that point to the same contract and this somehow having an adverse effect). As you can only have one graffiti per block, you can check if the contract has been called on the latest block already, so a second execution via the same block will be reverted.

```solidity
function onValidatorTriggered(uint32,uint256 _blockNumber,address,uint128) external override onlyAutomate
{
	if (_blockNumber <= latestMintedBlock) revert GhostBlock();
	latestMintedBlock = _blockNumber;
}
```

### Requesting for Immunity

It seems like you can request for Ticker Immunity from the Heroglyphs team if "your product offers significant advantages to the ecosystem". Otherwise, if your ticker goes underwater and you can't buy it back, you would have to get all your validators to migrate to a new ticker. 

This does open a security concern however: what if a ticker goes underwater and the hijacker makes it point to a malicious contract? What sort of malicious contracts can you even make it point to and have the user interact with? 

## Advanced Graffiti Minting

Given that the tokens exist on different chains, you can perform cross-chain minting.

For example, the `$LEUYGI` token exists on Base while the `$69` token exists on Arbitrum (by default, if you do not specify a chain to mine on, it will use Arbitrum).

You can then craft a graffiti like this: `#leuygi:h,69@ID`, where the `:h` is an "override symbol" to specify that `leuygi` will be minted on the chain associated with `h`, which in this case is Base. We don't have to write `:a` after `69` to mine it on Arbitrum thanks to the default system.

However, if you were to mint on a separate chain, you will need to pay a "layer-zero fee" on the target chain.

What the hell is a layer-zero fee?


## Clarifying $BADGES, Genesis NFTs and Genesis Tokens


### NFT Keys and OFT20

We now have more insight into what the NFTs and tokens are for. As previously speculated, it seems like in order to mine the genesis tokens (the tickers that are currently immune on the protocol), you will have to mint an associated genesis NFT (which is your "key").

It seems like these genesis tokens are also primarily OFT20 tokens (Omnichain Fungible Tokens, like [$OMNI](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/omnicat/), I think.) So you should be able to bridge the tokens across chains e.g. from Base to Arbitrum. Seems like your aforementioned layer-zero fees are the cost for bridging.

#### Sidenote: OFT20 in Brief [(ref)](https://medium.com/layerzero-official/explaining-the-oft-standard-310de5e84052)

So what is the OFT spec exactly? 

Essentially, to facilitate interchain activity, when you transfer N tokens from chain A to chain B, it burns N tokens on chain A and mints N tokens on chain B (this is done via cross-chain messages). Simple, right? 

Benefits: 
- Standardization of a token across chains
- Unification of token supply: you do not need to create wrapped tokens on each chain, instead working with native tokens on each chain.

With liquidity pools spread across multiple chains... arbitrage opportunities for Heroglyph tokens inbound? (Just like what happened to $OMNI fresh off its launch)


### Medals and $BADGES

Furthermore, you will receive **medals** when you successfully attest blocks (the current rate on the heroglyphs site has 1 Medal = 0.000297 $BADGES). So around 3367 successful attestations will allow you to claim 1 $BADGES, which can then be used to redeem a genesis token (you still need the associated genesis NFT to do this redemption).

It seems like if you miss an attestation to a proposed block, you also get penalised and your claimable medal count is deducted. 

[Here](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xE1439f74Cd5286Bf28B08978703BEd2068DE4260#code) is the contract for $BADGES, which also corroborates the point on the $BADGES being "soulbounded" (since your medals are tied to your validator's attestations). Do note that you still need to register an ID for the validators to be able to make any medal claims.

The Parent-Child relationship from earlier does not seem to apply here, so if I have multiple validators I cannot funnel my medals to one address.
