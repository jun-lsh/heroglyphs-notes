Currently, any information concerning the Heroglyphs ecosystem can only primarily be accessed via their site, https://heroglyphs.com. Of interest is how the tickers and identities are handled: what's going on under the hood?

## HeroglyphRelay.sol

Obviously, there has to be something in place that is looking out for the Graffitis themselves so that the minting can occur.

We see calls to [`0x384f025f8B1993584857A305C3b2fE181087ae78`](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x384f025f8B1993584857A305C3b2fE181087ae78), a contract called `HeroglyphRelay`.

We won't dig into the code that much because the code itself is fairly simple and as the name implies, exists simply to relay information.
### `executeRelay`

This function serves as the key bridge between off-chain and on-chain, and is only called if a produced block contains the relevant graffiti. There are two events that will be emitted on call, `BlockExecuted` and `TickerExecuted`, with the latter only being emitted after performing `callTicker`, which calls the contract associated with the ticker.

So who is calling `executeRelay`? Well, inspecting a [tx](https://arbiscan.io/tx/0x1eba105d9bdd95442060d0d99931db242621e905e1a7f44bbddfc847f4864452) gives us our answer: the Gelato network. As an automation protocol, it executes the contract as and when is needed. This also means it's a point of failure for Heroglyphs right now.

## Ticker.sol

[This contract](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xC843C7AE45b54d1eB1Cd7EA91Ce3A416F0247150#code) is responsible for the logic behind the tickers, including the ownership and hijacking stuff. As it states, "Tickers are contract identities \[without real ownership]"

Some points of interest:
- Ticker immunity for Genesis Tickers is handled by calling `createWithImmune`, which of course only the contract owner can call.
- We see the logic for taxation, which deals with when the last time the ticker tax has been paid and the amount due
- All of the earlier detailed metadata and logic are stored with this contract

## ValidatorIdentity.sol

[This contract](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x422116B10872523Efaa9ac16D4bb9868293e87E3#code) is responsible for the IDs and the delegation system. The logic seems sound and there's nothing really more to comment on; the metadata and information that you see on the page is very much what you get.

## HeroglyphAttestation.sol

[This contract](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x3554a4ceEf26C7BCAbC75BdE03648B7EC6ce59E3#contracts) is interesting as it concerns the rewards for attestation rather than the inscription of a graffiti. Here we can also find the associated [`$BADGES`](https://arbiscan.io/token/0x3554a4ceef26c7bcabc75bde03648b7ec6ce59e3) token, which is an OFT token (clarifying, it is an extended ERC-20 token, whose spec is described [here](https://docs.layerzero.network/v1/developers/evm-guides/contract-standards/oft-overview) )

Functions which will perform the rewarding e.g. `SendBatchToExecute` are called with the block's validator indexes (not to be confused with the validator ID that concerns the Heroglyph spec, we're talking about regular ETH block validator IDs) [specified in the function call](https://arbiscan.io/tx/0xd77cb320b7911286aece84e1f7892361f21ffd0b56014714a2b0e55992559d5e#eventlog) .

## HeroLinearToken20.sol

Our Genesis Tokens (which are tokens which should be following the intended spec as they have been created by the owners) all point to the [`HeroLinearToken20.sol` contract](https://arbiscan.io/token/0x4ff5f900eca8f848bedf09fbff7d1caa2c11a857#code), which appears to be a modified version of the aforementioned LayerZero OFT spec.

In here, our functions concerning minting and redemption are specified. I'm not really here to do a full smart contract audit and just giving it a cursory look, the contract logic appears sound. After all, it's just a token spec.
