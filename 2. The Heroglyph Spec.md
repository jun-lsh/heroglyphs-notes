## Who is a Complete Validator?

- Firstly, of course you have to be a validator, one with 32 ETH to spare. 
- Your `withdrawal_credential` as a validator cannot point to a contract address (or, well, shouldn't)
	- This can supposedly help single out validators which are run by centralized entities as assuming they are of type 0x01, they would point to a smart contract address in order to facilitate the eventual distributions of block rewards.
- As of right now, you require the ownership of a **Genesis NFT** to be considered.
	- This appears to have cucked over a lot of people and is currently lacking in a lot of much needed clarification.

This means that as long as you're running your own node, specifying the correct graffiti when validating blocks and holding a Genesis NFT, you _should_ be able to receive tokens associated with the NFT (details a few sections down). So, AWS and cloud nodes are not out of the question.

## Tickers

Tickers correspond to the Heroglyphs Tokens that we've been talking about.

Every ticker contains the following fields:
- A name 
- Associated smart contract
	- These token contracts will be inspected later
- Owner
- Price (to buy over the ticker)
- Taxes (an amount that has to be paid to retain control over the ticker, proportional to the price that's set for the ticker and time spent since last payment)
- Hijackable date (when the ticker can be hijacked, if the taxes aren't being paid)

Concerning hijacking of tickers, there are three states:
- `IMMU`
	- these are the tickers corresponding to the Genesis NFTs, which we shall refer to Genesis Tickers
	- presumably, these cannot be hijacked, and these tokens seem to be only claimable if you own the associated Genesis NFT, which is what you're able to mint on the site
	- as explored in document 3 where we look at the smart contracts themselves, these tokens have been minted by the Heroglyphs dev team
	- seems to be "immune" rather than "immutable", haha.
- `PROT
	- The ticker is still in a protected state until it expires. Basically means you can't hijack it, not until the taxes go unpaid and the hijackable date is reached.
- `HI-J 
	- It's up for grabs and can be modified by a purchasing party
	- After hijacking, besides the token name itself, the associated contract and the price can be modified

Right now, the primary concern is with the hijacking system. If a token were to be hijacked and their contract is changed, what happens to the old token contract? It should still remain tradable as an OFT20 token, but no new tokens would be minted unless another ticker (or the same old ticker) were to be hijacked or created, with the "new" ticker pointing to this contract.

## IDs

Quoting the FAQ, IDs behave as an ENS in the Heroglyphs ecosystem. When you "mine" a token, you need some way to identify who would receive the reward that isn't just the contract address.

IDs have the following properties:
- Name
- Owner
- Receiver (who is receiving the rewards)
- Delegate 
	- Delegation Price
	- Delegation Duration

If you aren't a validator, you can still mint an ID and then delegate it to someone who is a validator and presumably receive a cut of their rewards + the base profits of selling the ID to them.

## The Graffiti Format 

So now we come down to the Graffiti format itself. As previously stated, it is a 32 byte chunk of data that can be appended to the block header by a block proposer (byte, not just char, which means you're free to use non-ASCII characters).

A sample Graffiti following the format looks like this:

`#x,X,0,_,lasagna@[]-a`

- Following `#`, tickers are listed, separated by commas
- Following `@` is the ID name
- Following `-` is the chain ID (`a` for Arbitrum, the only supported one for now)

So for this example, the validator mined `x`, `X`, `0`, `_` and `lasagna`, where the mined tokens will be deposited to the account associated with `@[]`

Thus, we find that shorter IDs are preferable (you can include more tickers) and the length of the ticker can be interpreted as either longer being better (increased scarcity as there is lowered incentive to mine it) or short being better (increased mining volume as it can be tacked on more easily in a mining graffiti).

## The NFTs

This is the part that's a little bit vague and confusing.

- It appears right now, to be able to mint an ID, you need to own a Genesis NFT (e.g. `$GNOBBY`, `$SANICSUPERSPEED`, etc.). 
- Furthermore, to receive the tokens themselves, you also need to own the Genesis NFT (e.g. to receive [`$LASAGNA`](https://arbiscan.io/token/0xfa4adaeb61eac93ca5713f0ed1c4d99ae162d25d#code) , you need to own a [`$GARFFELDO`](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x7d35995Ec68BcA71849068e0FC91EB75641c9aA8#code) NFT)
- These NFTs are `KeyOFT721` contracts (so, NFT keys), where OFT here appears to mean "Omnichain Fungible Token"
- It seems like you can received increased rewards by holding the NFT? 
- The NFTs and Genesis Tokens also seem to be associated with certain chains (e.g. `$BERA` and Berachain), which should probably end up being specified in the Graffiti when mining


## Is Minting Live?

Right now, at least in the Discord FAQ, it says that Claims are not live yet. Inspecting some TXs, we see this is not actually the case:

Here is [an address](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x0ce2765b3adcf1bc7d5a12eb05e50eccf2d896c2) that owns a bunch of the Genesis NFTs (in particular, the lueygi, KABOSU, PORIGON, SCRIBES and GARFELDO keys). 

They were the block proposer for block number [19843098](https://etherscan.io/block/19843098) , which contained the graffiti `#x,X,0,_,lasagna@[]-a` . We can check the the ID `@[]` does correspond to the owner `0x0ce2765B3adcF1bc7D5A12Eb05e50eCCF2D896c2` on the Heroglyphs site.

We can see that there are [TXs](https://arbiscan.io/tx/0xdbb2e746f8809d353570366b59e3b4026743acf4ed6555309751ad9c33310f3a) in which this ID has been rewarded the associated tokens (`$LASAGNA` in this example), which means minting does appear to be live.
