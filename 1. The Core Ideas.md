## The Whitepaper

- The purported goal of Heroglyphs is to prevent a centralization/consolidation of validation to a limited number of node providers, a symptom of liquid staking.
- Heroglyphs creates an incentive to be a "Complete Validator" by creating a pseudo-PoW reward system in which a validator can "mine" Heroglyph Tokens (or _Tickers_). 
- This leverages _Graffiti_, 32 bytes of data that can be appended to an ETH block header by the validator that proposes the block.
	- At a technical level, this makes it closer to using BTC's OP_RETURN field rather than the much more complicated method in which satoshi inscriptions are performed
	- Graffiti themselves are a passive data element and would thus require an Encoder/Decoder to serve any functionality. 
- As the odds of being a block proposer is weighed against your effective ETH balance (which is capped at 32 ETH), it mitigates the "economic advantage" that larger operators hold [(ref)](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/block-proposal/) 
- Heroglyphs, as a reward, are not intrinsically tied to the value of ETH. They can thus surpass ETH block rewards themselves as an incentive to spin up a solo validator node.

## Can this Decentralize Nodes?

**TL;DR:** The incentive system does line up with what they say: it is closer to how PoW rewards on, say, BTC are being distributed. And in theory, if the rewards are sufficient/effective, then it would promote spinning up independent nodes to reap those benefits. However, in practice, we do see that in live PoW systems (lowest hanging fruit, BTC) that centralization of power still occurs. Assuming that validators from "centralized entities" can be singled out based on their withdrawal address, perhaps the system _can_ be made to reward solo validators only, making it effective.

As to whether this would decentralize nodes, at a simple level, it depends on how effective of an incentive these Heroglyph Tokens can be. 

Let's use the contrapositive: how does this decentivize liquid staking?

If you were to stake your ETH via liquid staking, you can receive block rewards without 1) having to deal with the technical details of setting up a validator and 2) you can behave as a validator without requiring 32 ETH.

However, Heroglyph Tokens are only rewarded to individual validators, namely the address tied to the validator which proposes the block which contains the correct Graffiti that denotes the mining of a Heroglyph Token. Unless the validator splits the rewarded Heroglyph Tokens (or liquidates them, then shares the reward) across all individuals that share their ETH to stake, the user which contributes their ETH would lose out on this additional reward.

On paper, we can mitigate this. Entities like LIDO which take your capital and outsource node operators to spin up validators run thousands of individual validators themselves (that happen to be considered "centralized" as they are under a singular aforementioned entity). Each individual validator that the node operators run _can participate_ in Heroglyph Token mining by including the appropriate Graffiti if they are recognised as a "Complete Validator", sidestepping the measures taken to avoid centralization. 

As such, we need to figure out just how a "Complete Validator" is identified and whether there is any system in place that can differentiate validators owned by centralized entities and solo validators. 

Quoting the Whitepaper: _"To prevent a small number of partial validators who delegate validation operations from becoming the beneficiaries of this system and further centralization, validators whose deposit/withdraw address is a contract address could be automatically excluded from mining."_ 

This makes sense as to uphold the trustless system of staking, the withdrawal credentials of the validators should be of type 0x01 and point to a smart contract that will ensure that rewards will eventually make its way back to those who contribute to staking [(ref for LIDO's case)](https://blog.lido.fi/the-road-to-trustless-ethereum-staking/) If your major staking pools all operate on this principle (granted, even in the case of LIDO, they still have type 0x00 withdrawal credentials that point to a standard multisig wallet) and their validators predominantly behave this way, that aforementioned differentiation can be done and the project's principles remain in place.

All in all, the outlook isn't particularly grim. In order for there to be a consolidation/centralization of power and continue to reap the rewards from it, entities which employ centralized validators would have to undermine what makes their systems trustless, which _should_ dissuade contributing to their staking pool and create greater incentives to behave as a solo validator to reap the rewards of Heroglyphs as an independent entity. 
## What is $BADGE?

Lifting from the Whitepaper: _"Heroglyphs mining ensures that all Complete Validators receive rewards for their participation, regardless of whether they are selected as block proposers."_ 

Given that you can only manipulate the Graffiti to mine Heroglyph Tokens _iff you are a block proposer_, how do you receive rewards otherwise? 

It appears that Heroglyphs also offers another token, one divorced from the free for all "Tickers", called $BADGES, which can be claimed when you perform attestations as a validator (as long as you have a valid `withdrawal_credential`), after which these $BADGES can then be used to redeem Heroglyph Tokens/Tickers.

This system also relies on the filtering process (of differentiating solo validators from centralized validators) being effective.

This seems to be Work in Progress.
